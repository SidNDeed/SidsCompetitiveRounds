"""A1 identity-first formation primitives (rejoin batch, 2026-09-17).

Covers the primitives themselves; the per-site wiring has its own tests. The
helpers are EXECUTED against a fake session that records every statement, in
the style of test_queue_pair_writers.py -- a test that reads the source instead
of running it cannot fail for the reason we care about (#441).

Acceptance items from ai-collab/rejoin/A1-BRIEF.md covered here:

  item 2  every ordering oracle is exercised with a planted misordered trace
          AND with a source mutation, so a green result means the oracle can
          actually go red.
  item 3  the strict lease reader propagates; the three lease policies are
          told apart by their reason strings, not merely by "something
          refused".
  item 4  the REAL advisory-lock bind sequence is captured and asserted,
          including duplicate collapse. Note what is deliberately NOT tested:
          r1 asked for a steam-id pair that sorts differently lexically than
          numerically, and no such pair exists -- canonical SteamID64s are
          fixed-width 17-digit ASCII decimals, so the two orders coincide.
          The bind-sequence assertion replaces it, and the short-id case below
          is what actually separates _ffa_sort_key from bare sorted().
