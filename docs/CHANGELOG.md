# Sid's Competitive Rounds — Changelog

## v1.20.0 — Economy, Chat, Betting, Trails

Mandatory update. The server rejects any client below v1.20.0 with a 426 response,
and the mod auto-prompts the update on launch.

### Economy / Shop
- **Gold currency**. 100 XP = 1 gold. +25 gold per achievement. +5 gold on a ranked series win, +1 more on a 2-0 sweep.
- **Shop tab** with titles and trails (separated into labelled sections, sorted cheapest-first per tier).
- **Titles** (10): Beginner, Regular, Active, Clown, Sweaty, Tryhard, Competitor, Kingslayer, Grandmaster, Royal.
- **Cosmetic trails** (7): Clean Trail, Crimson Streak, Azure Comet, Emerald Glow, Phoenix Flame, Void Ripple, Prismatic Wake.
  - Trail **length scales with price tier** (3k short / 5k medium / 10k long).
  - Prismatic trail cycles through the full color spectrum in real time.
  - **Photon-synced** — other mod users see your trail behind your player during matches.
  - Toggleable in Settings → Display → Cosmetic trails.
- **Active title** renders in leaderboard rows (bold, colored), chat messages (both in-game and Discord), and the My Stats Discord Link row.
- **Gold column on the leaderboard** (sortable). My Stats shows gold balance inline with W/L.
- **Gold breakdown** in the after-match notification: `+9 gold [XP +3, Series win +5, Sweep +1]`. Match history rows show `+N xp +N g`.

### Betting
- **Live Ranked Games** panel on the Leaderboard tab shows in-progress series with current score and both players' Elo-based odds.
- Bet preset stakes (100g / 500g / 2000g) on either player. Odds = `1 / P(win)`, capped at **3x** so the largest payout is 3× stake. Favorite-bets at `|ΔElo| ≥ 800` return ~1.01x (essentially nothing).
- **Can't bet on your own match** — UI hides the stake buttons when your Steam ID is a participant, and the server 409s anyway.
- Bets settle the instant the series completes; winners credit gold automatically.

### In-game ↔ Discord chat bridge
- **WebSocket endpoint** `/api/v1/ws/chat` with long-lived connections, 25-second keepalive pings to survive NAT timeouts, and a queue-based serialized sender so rapid-fire messages don't overlap.
- **Two-way bridge** via a Discord bot subscribed to `#scr-discussion`. In-game messages appear as `**Name [Title] (1946)** (in-game): ...` in Discord.
- **Chat panel** in My Stats (under Discord Link). Press **T** while the F5 menu is open to type and send; Enter sends, Esc cancels.
- **In-game chat overlay** (bottom-left, auto-fade after 35s) so you don't have to open F5 to see new messages. Toggle in Settings.
- **Scrollback** — last 50 messages persisted server-side and loaded on connect.
- **Rating** attached to every message so you can verify someone claiming to be a top player. Works across both bridge directions.
- **Local echo** so your own message appears instantly; server-side broadcast excludes the sender to avoid duplicate rendering.

### Privacy & data consent
- **First-launch consent modal** explaining exactly what gets collected: Steam ID, Discord link, match data, Glicko history. Requires explicit Allow or Decline.
- **Revoke consent** in Settings → full offline mode. Ranked mode turns off, chat disconnects, no API traffic.
- **Delete my data** — anonymizes your row (Steam ID → `deleted_<uuid>`, display name → `[Deleted User]`, Discord link scrubbed). Matches stay so **other players' ratings and histories aren't retroactively disturbed**.
- **Deletion is irreversible** — a server-salted hash of the deleted Steam ID is kept in a blocklist. Re-registration re-creates the row as a permanent `[Deleted User]` tombstone so account-wipe-to-reset-rating spoofing isn't possible.
- **Anonymized players hidden** from leaderboards and skipped by the Glicko recalc.
- **Version gate**: `X-Mod-Version` header on every request. Client version below `MIN_MOD_VERSION` gets 426 and is prompted to update.

### Pass-tracking
- The mod captures every card **offered** during pick phase (not just the one picked), sends them with the match report.
- New `card_offers` table. Stats queries compute **pass rate** (`1 - picked / offered`) per card.
- **Pass%** column in the Card Stats tab, sortable.

### Achievement & gameplay fixes
- **Immovable Object & Pacifist** gate rewritten. The pick-phase state (Space to confirm, A/D to browse cards) was incorrectly counting as "moved" / "fired", blocking both achievements. New `inPickPhase` flag driven by ROUNDS log markers (`PICK PHASE`, `MOVE PLAYERS END`, `Round over`) — achievements fire only during actual combat now.
- Retroactive grants for Stan and Noah.
- Pacifist achievement fix from the same root cause.

### Auto-update
- Mod auto-fires the update handler on launch when it detects a newer `LATEST_MOD_VERSION` from the server.
- The direct-Discord build writes a `.bat` apply-on-exit script; Thunderstore build (no `.bat` allowed) shows a notification instead. Both paths are already gated by `#if THUNDERSTORE`.

### UI polish
- **Settings tab** (5th tab) with Data Consent status, Revoke, Delete My Data (two-step confirm + explicit irreversibility warning), and display toggles (FPS, Region/Ping, In-game chat overlay, Cosmetic trails).
- **Chat notifications** toggle controls the on-screen pop-ups for incoming chat + XP / level.
- **Click-to-reveal** on the Discord link row so streamers don't accidentally doxx themselves.
- **F5 menu auto-closes** when combat starts (on `MOVE PLAYERS END`) so it can't block clicks during play.
- F5 chat log now word-wraps.
- Leaderboard title rendered bold + in the title's color next to the name.
- Cosmetic trails can be toggled off mid-match without relaunching; toggling back on re-attaches.

### Server
- **Version-gate middleware** returns 426 with `{"required": "1.20.0", "current": "..."}` for any client below `MIN_MOD_VERSION`.
- `/api/v1/shop/items`, `/api/v1/shop/purchase`, `/api/v1/players/{steam_id}/inventory`, `/api/v1/players/{steam_id}/active-title`, `/api/v1/players/{steam_id}/active-trail`, `/api/v1/players/{steam_id}/data` (anonymize), `/api/v1/bets`, `/api/v1/series/active`, `/api/v1/chat/recent`, `/api/v1/chat/post`, `/api/v1/ws/chat`.
- **Card-stats materialized view unique index fixed**. Previously the view grouped by `(card_name, card_rarity)` but the unique index was on `card_name` alone, causing REFRESH CONCURRENTLY to fail whenever the same card appeared with multiple rarities.
- **Poison / Poison Bullets** + **Prisitne Perseverence / Pristine Perseverence** deduped — both the current stream (via client alias in `CardRarityLookup`) and the backfilled rows.
- **Discord username backfill** — the bot resolves all linked Discord IDs to usernames on startup. In-game display shows `@username` instead of numeric ID.
- **Rating-change swap fix** — `p1_rating_change` / `p2_rating_change` now map correctly to the series player order (match-report p1/p2 can differ from series creation order).

# v1.18.7 Changelog

## Leaderboard Improvements

### Rating Line Graph
- Replaced the confusing bar chart in the player detail panel with a proper **line graph**
- When Elo rating history is available (≥2 data points), displays a blue **Rating History** line showing Elo over time with dots at each data point, y-axis labels for rating range, and a clean title above the graph
- Falls back to a green **Ranked Form** line (running W/L score) when rating history data isn't available yet
- Fixed text overlapping the graph — title now renders above the plot area instead of behind the bars

### Rating History Data Fix
- **Root cause found**: the inline Glicko-2 recalculation after ranked series completion was updating ratings but never saving snapshots to the `rating_history` table — only the weekly Monday cron did
- Now saves a `RatingHistory` snapshot for both players after every series completion, so the Elo graph populates going forward with each ranked series played

### Form Data Now Series-Based
- Recent form data now pulls from **completed ranked series** instead of all individual matches (ranked + casual)
- Each W/L entry on the graph corresponds to a series result that changed Elo, not individual games
- Graph label updated to "Ranked Form" to reflect this

### Leaderboard Column Centering
- Fixed leaderboard table alignment — columns now center in the available space instead of being pushed to one side with a visible gap

### Recent Ranked Series Pagination
- Added **Prev/Next** pagination buttons to the Recent Ranked Series panel (left column)
- Displays 8 series per page with a page indicator
- Panel no longer wastes vertical space showing an empty area below a handful of entries

## Leave % Tracking (Full Stack)

### How It Works
- Tracks when a player **disconnects during a ranked match** where ≥2 total points have been scored and neither player has ≥4 rounds
- Matches where someone already has ≥4 rounds are handled by the existing DC Win/DC Loss system and don't count toward leave %
- Only tracked for ranked matches, not casual

### Detection
- Client detects opponent disconnects by monitoring `PhotonNetwork.PlayerList` — when the list drops to 1 player during an active ranked match, the remaining player reports the disconnect
- New `POST /api/v1/report-disconnect` server endpoint records the event
- Separate from match reporting — not affected by the "lower Steam ID reports" rule
